# Process Schedueling Algorithms

The experiment folders as given above contain, the schedueling information in the following order:

- __Experiment-3__ : First Come First Serve Algorithm (FCFS)
- __Experiment-4__ : Shortest Job First ALgorithm (SJF)
- __Experiment-5__ : Shortest Remaining Time First Algorithm(SRTF)
- __Experiment-6__ : Priority Schedueling Algorithm
- __Experiment-7__ : Round Robin Schedueling Algorithm

### Description: 

The following codes have been implemented in C++, and are made especially for handling the difficult situation cases such as varied arrival times in the CPU, handling starvation and other such faults which are not covered by the standard codes found on various sites.

### Future Updates:

- Uploading images of outputs on the terminal
- adding the pre-emptive version of Priority schedueling
- adding the varied arrival time version for Round Robin Schedueling
- More schedueling algorithms
